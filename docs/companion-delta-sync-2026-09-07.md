# Companion T0/T1 compatibility delta, 2026-09-07

This offline audit compares companion root
`804ef3dfb5194eedc73e93b3ccf54ad226336130` against the previous audited
boundary `bf314be42b62b69c87c8825bf473286bf524a79b`, using clean
open_kaishek baseline
`main == origin/main == ce62218a01020a55d88b511ba200fd768a3b19d0`.
No CK3 process was started or
attached.

## Compatibility decision

`NO-CODE-CHANGE`: the companion range requires no parser vocabulary, IR node,
finite-runtime handler, profile descriptor, CLI command, or Quarkus service
change in open_kaishek.

The existing exact-build identity remains CK3 `1.19.0.6`, executable SHA-256
`2D00FF3101EF70B566F2FCBAE292F09263199C80E9DC8F139B82D7D96F83DB86`.
The audited range adds no `game.command.*` or `game.contract.*` literal. The
open_kaishek G2 capability remains the read-only
`game.command.query-g2-truce-evaluated-days-v1` descriptor with the same eight
response fields and five invariants. The Zhongguo promotion-source,
career-HC/workforce, manager/subordinate selector, and their pinned ABI,
source-contract, and Python-contract files are byte-identical across the
range.

## T1: G2 orchestration delta

The companion adds two parent-owned orchestration surfaces after the previous
three-way intake audit:

- `surrender_execution_readiness` projects the already composed assessment,
  candidate, and six-domain surrender terms into a Python policy result. It
  neither registers an open_kaishek capability nor changes the evaluated-days
  query.
- `xar.ck3.g2_three_way_exit_file_intake.v1` adds a hash-bound offline file
  intake. Manifest v1 is retained, while
  `raiktor-three-way-exit-file-intake-manifest-v2` optionally binds the
  surrender aggregate session. Its verified envelopes retain an empty
  mutation-command list and do not advertise an action or postcondition.

These are consumer/orchestration schemas in the companion repository, not
Paradox opcodes or public open_kaishek parser/IR/runtime transports. Adding a
speculative mirror would create a second authority for policy state, so the
correct compatibility action is provenance-only.

## T0: Phase 2 R192-R208 delta

The range includes the AF5 compensation-loop repair and the retained-session
progression through R208. R201-R208 add or refine exact event-window contracts
for health, spymaster, befriend, annual-summary, elimination, and PP
bargaining/receipt prompts. Those contracts live under the companion `tools/`
acceptance harness; they do not extend open_kaishek's public profile surface.

The product script changes are nevertheless covered as external parser input.
They include purpose-sharded compensation effects and small trigger/effect
repairs. The current 827-file Zhongguo corpus still parses losslessly. This is
syntax/CST coverage only: R208 remains a retained-session harness RED at the
next exact PP event, and neither promotion nor full-tree readiness is promoted
by this audit.

The shared native GUI dispatch implementation was corrected in the companion,
but its fixed review-now request, response fields, invariants, and
default-unadvertised product capability are unchanged. No open_kaishek profile
pin names that implementation file, so there is no stale source hash to
refresh here.

## Verification

- `py -B tools/check_metadata.py`: PASS.
- `mvn -o -ntp clean verify`: BUILD SUCCESS; 156 tests, zero failures,
  errors, or skips.
- `py -B -m unittest discover -s kaishek-zg361-profile/tests -v`: 8/8 PASS.
- `py -B kaishek-zg361-profile/tools/validate_domains.py`: PASS
  (`schema-only; runtime not implemented`).
- Shaded CLI JAR: 362,766 bytes; SHA-256
  `2e2e9f7edee40158cfe960390dcbf4279bf3fa75d8bc61500eb7de7a1ae5ba2e`.
- The three assertions from `kaishek-cli/smoke.ps1`: PASS by direct CLI
  invocation; the local PowerShell policy rejected executing the unsigned
  wrapper itself.
- `synthetic-361`: SUCCESS, explicitly synthetic, with 0 parse and 0
  validation diagnostics.
- Companion `XenoAmess_s_Eternal_Recurrence`: 54/54 files, 2,217,794 bytes,
  zero errors, corpus SHA-256
  `bf36f9e2e8c1cbf1880f4231029bb66a81e66e97684ca877397056b30b633ab5`.
- Companion `mod_zhongguo_style`: 827/827 files, 23,464,880 bytes, zero
  errors, corpus SHA-256
  `33528d077dc79c3ccf02bd3529ea0ffdcfa27747d8043c9af27289c0b3bae2c8`.
- Companion `verify_g2_open_kaishek_compatibility.py --require-checkout
  --require-clean`: `GREEN_STATIC` against the clean `ce62218` baseline; every
  reported compatibility check is true. After this provenance-only commit
  lands, the companion's exact checkout pin must advance to the new
  open_kaishek commit before repeating the same clean-checkout assertion.
